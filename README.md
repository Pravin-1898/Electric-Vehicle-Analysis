⚡ Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard
This project is a data visualization and analytics dashboard built using a public dataset from Kaggle to analyze trends in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. It showcases insights on vehicle types, manufacturers, eligibility, and performance metrics like range — using a combination of Excel for data prep and Power BI for dashboard creation.

📦 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Electric Vehicle Population Data

Format: CSV file with details on electric vehicles by make, model, type, range, eligibility, and more

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Excel: Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

Power BI: Dashboard design, DAX calculations, and interactive visuals

🎯 Project Goals
Understand the growth and distribution of EVs over time

Identify top manufacturers and models by volume

Compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs)

Visualize average electric range and CAFV eligibility

Enable dynamic filtering by state, model, type, etc.

📊 Dashboard Highlights
Total Vehicles: 116.74K

Average Range: 78.56 km (for BEVs)

Top Manufacturers: Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, etc.

Top Models: Model Y, Model 3, Leaf, Bolt EV

CAFV Eligibility Split: Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV), Not Eligible, Unknown

🔍 Techniques Used
Power Query:

Column unpivoting

Null handling and missing data filtering

Data type conversion

DAX Measures:

Calculated total and average metrics

Conditional filters (e.g., vehicle eligibility by CAFV)

Data Relationships: Merging and creating model relationships for filtering and cross-filtering
